# PK - Package

Or NyPK to be specific

This is a simple archive type standard, that can store multiple files in one.
There is no compression algorithm applied.

## Standards
- Header is variable size to minimize space

## Modes
> [!NOTE]
> Any good implementation would pick the minimum mode possible for the files it wants to archive. That way, size is reduced as much as possible.
